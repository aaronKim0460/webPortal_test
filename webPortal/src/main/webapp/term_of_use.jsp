        <p>
            Information on this Site is not intended for residents of states or countries where specific companies or products are not
            authorized or licensed, or where any content of or transaction on this site is unlawful. Those who choose to access this

            This Site may provide general information about the Site Sponsor and the products and services offered by the Group.
            Information on the Site does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any particular product or service.
            Some products and services may not be available in all states, and the products and services are generally not available
            for purchase outside the United States. Your eligibility for particular products and services is subject to final
            determination, restrictions and acceptance by us or member of Group that issues the product or service.
            <br>
            <br>
            Site Sponsor or Group may discontinue or make changes to the information, products, licenses or services described herein
            at any time. Any dated information is published as of its publication date only. The Site Sponsor and Group do not
            undertake any obligation or responsibility to update or amend any such information. The Site Sponsor and Group reserve
            the right to terminate any or all offerings without prior notice to the user. Furthermore, by offering information,
            products or services via this Site, no solicitation is made by Site Sponsor or the Group to any person to use such
            information, products or services in jurisdictions where the provision of information, products or services is prohibited by law.
        </p>
        <h4>6. You Authorize Us to Collect and Use Information About You</h4>
        <p>
            You hereby authorize the Site Sponsor and Group to collect aggregate information which is not personally identifiable to
            you about your use of this Site. You also authorize us to use information which is personally identifiable to you (or others)
            that you send us to provide any service you request.
        </p>
        <h4>7. We Do Not Provide Investment Advice or Solicit Offers</h4>
        <p>
            This Site and the information contained herein do not constitute investment advice, an offer, or a solicitation for the purchase
            or sale of any securities or insurance product. The Site may contain information and press releases about the Site Sponsor and
            Group, and although this information was believed to be accurate as of the date prepared, Site Sponsor disclaims any duty or
            obligation to update such information.
            <br>
            <br>
            If any information is construed to be an offer for the purchase and sale of securities, please consult the appropriate prospectus
            and other registration documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). To the extent any information on this
            Site is deemed to be a "forward looking statement" as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities Act of 1933, as
            amended, and specifically the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such information is intended to fit within the
            "safe harbor" for forward looking information and is subject to material risk factors which may or may not be disclosed herein.
            You can identify "forward looking" statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They
            may use such language as "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" or other similar language.
            Any "forward looking" statement on this Site or in other information may turn out to be incorrect. Such statements may be
            affected by inaccurate assumptions or by unknown risks and uncertainties. Therefore, actual results may vary materially and there
            are no guarantees about any security. We do not undertake any obligation to revise any "forward looking" statement to reflect
            changes in events, circumstances or expectations.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you desire to purchase a security of any kind we recommend that you contact a qualified stockbroker or financial advisor.
            <br>
            <br>
            Do not rely on stock price information on this Site. While we believe that any such information is accurate, we cannot guarantee
            or warrant the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information. More specifically, you should not rely on any stock
            price information on this Site for specific investment transactions. We are not liable for any loss or damages, whether direct,
            indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary, that may arise from reliance on the stock price information or the
            Investor Relations home page.
        </p>
        <h4>8. No Client, Fiduciary or Professional Relationship is Established by Providing Information On This Site.</h4>
        <p>
            We make every reasonable effort to provide you with sound information at our Site. We also invite you to make personal contact
            with us via non-Internet means. However, limitations of the Internet do not allow us to establish a client, fiduciary or professional
            relationship with you through this Site. Accordingly, we require that:
            <br>
            <br>
            YOU AGREE THAT NO CLIENT, ADVISORY, FIDUCIARY OR PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP IS CREATED, IMPLIED OR ESTABLISHED BETWEEN YOU AND THE
            SITE SPONSOR OR GROUP AND THAT YOU AGREE AND UNDERSTAND THAT NO PERSON OR ENTITY IS, IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SITE, ENGAGED IN
            RENDERING AUDITING, ACCOUNTING, INVESTMENT, SECURITIES, TAX, LEGAL ADVICE OR CONSULTING OPINIONS AND THAT YOU WILL CONSULT
            APPROPRIATE LICENSED PROFESSIONALS FOR OPINIONS AND ADVICE RELATING TO THE SPECIFIC FACTS, LAWS AND ROLES WHICH MAY APPLY IN
            YOUR SPECIFIC CASE.
            <br>
            <br>
            We invite you to contact us via non-Internet means regarding critical information using the contact information in Section 16 of these Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <h4>9. Arbitration And Disputes in California</h4>
        <p>
            You hereby agree that all disputes and causes of action arising out of use of this Site may be arbitrated (at the sole discretion
            of Site Sponsor) in a non-binding arbitration by a single arbitrator selected by the Site Sponsor and conducted in Los Angeles
            County, California, or such other location, as the Site Sponsor may choose in its sole discretion, under the rules of the American
            Arbitration Association ("AAA") and the California Rules of Civil Procedure with limited discovery. The judgment of the arbitrator
            may be executable in any civil court. Site Sponsor will pay to AAA arbitration fees in excess of the first $500 U.S. dollars for
            you once you have paid $500 to AAA, but in no case more than a total of $3,000 arising out of any single, group or class cause of
            action. The losing party shall pay all costs and fees. Equitable actions for temporary restraining orders or injunctions may be
            instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction concerning the use, misuse or improper dissemination of information.
            <br>
            <br>
            You agree to submit to personal jurisdiction in Los Angeles County, California, and that the venue of any lawsuit, dispute or cause
            of action of any kind or in any forum, whether arising in tort, contract, or otherwise, including but not limited to actions arising
            out of any use, inability to use or viewing of this Site, or the terms or subject matter of this Terms of Use shall be in Los Angeles
            County, California, or such other venue as may be determined by the Site Sponsor or Group in its sole discretion, and that the law
            to be applied shall be the law of Indiana, without regard to conflict of law principles.
        </p>
        <h4>10. Failure to Exercise Rights Does Not Constitute Waiver</h4>
        <p>
            No failure, omission or delay on the part of Site Sponsor or Group in exercising any right under this Agreement will preclude any
            other further exercise of that right or other right under this Agreement.
        </p>
        <h4>11. You Agree to Changes and Amendments by Posting on this Site</h4>
        <p>
            The Site Sponsor reserves the right to change these Terms of Use, any Site content or any Site Rules at any time without notice and
            in our sole discretion, by (1) posting a change notice or a new Terms Of Use on our Site, or (2) using commercially reasonable efforts
            to notify you via email, if provided. Any change to these Terms of Use or any Site Rules shall be effective as to you or any user who
            uses this Site without notice, by posting of the Terms of Use as changed on this Site, with or without notice of any specific changes.
            You agree that you will comply with these Terms of Use and any Site Rules as they may be modified from time to time by the Site Sponsor
            by checking for modifications on this Site, whether or not you have received notice of any changes by e-mail or otherwise. If any
            modifications of this Terms Of Use are unacceptable to you, your only recourse is to terminate this Agreement. Your continued use of
            this Site following your receipt of notice of any modifications will constitute binding acceptance of any modification. Any inconsistent
            terms between this Agreement and any subsequent modifications or Terms of Use posted on this Site shall be controlled according to the
            latest posting.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although we try to protect information you send us, we cannot guarantee that information sent over the Internet is completely confidential.
            There are certain aspects of Internet usage, your computer and your links to the Internet we cannot control. Therefore, transmission of
            information to us on the Internet must be undertaken at your own risk.
        </p>
        <h4>14. You Authorize E-mail Response To Inquiries</h4>
        <p>
            We will respond to your inquiries and questions via e-mail if you provide us with an e-mail address. However, be advised that information
            sent by e-mail may not be completely confidential not only because of certain aspects of electronic transfer, but also because others may
